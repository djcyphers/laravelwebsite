<p>I was born on a beautiful island in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. Grew up the first five years of my life there, enjoying the people and the many celebrations on the beach. 
    There couldn't have been a better paradise to begin an interesting life.</p>

<p>Living in Washington now for about twenty years. I've grown to enjoy the rain and cold. Yet, this place isn't a one season location either. 
    So while enduring this climate, there is at least the reward of a summer. No matter how short it always seems. 
    Of course it also helps to have good friends to get you through the cold. There's definitely fun and interesting people to meet here! Just bring an umbrella.</p>

<p>My life's passion...</p>

<p>I discovered House Music back in 1996. It was truly an amazing experience finding such sounds. 
    In 1998 I bought my first pair of Technic 1200's and from there I've been hooked on anything dance music. 
    My earlier inspirations from the dance scene were Donald Glaude, DJ Dan, Paul Van Dyke, Sasha and Digweed, Pete Tong, and Carl Cox. 
    My current batch of favorite music producers would have to be LuckyDate, Le Castle Vania, Lazy Rich, Computer Club, and many others involved with Complextro/Electro House genres.</p><br/>
